## Cover letter

* First of all, that task doesn't take 2-3 hours for implementation, Task is the widest range. I estimate it as one week of solid development (40 hours) for a single developer. I mean all needed modules, models, pipes, styles, interaction cases, I'm already silent about testing.

Best way to implement it in one or two days is to separate parts of this task between 3-4 developers. I know how.

_Middle_ - can make all necessarily layouts (The 5th paragraph contains words about some screenshots, but nothing is attached). Layouts could have been provided from the designers team.

_Seniors_ - can implement services (business logic), model, data structures.

_Tech lead_ - should find out and ask the correct question to clarify all possible information about. Should assign tasks to developers.
